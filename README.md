# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks, each implementing a different machine learning algorithm from scratch in Python. The purpose is to demonstrate the inner workings of the algorithms and provide a hands-on experience with the fundamentals of machine learning.

## Contents

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees.ipynb
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Dbscan
- KNN
- Ensemble Learning

## Notebooks Description

Each notebook contains a step-by-step guide to implement a machine learning algorithm, including data preprocessing, mathematical concepts, coding the algorithm, and testing it on a dataset.

### Example: Linear Regression.ipynb

- Demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression.
- Covers the cost function, gradient descent, and model evaluation.
- Includes visualizations for a better understanding of the algorithm.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
